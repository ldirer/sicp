;From the book:
;Compare the two versions of analyze-sequence. For ex-
;ample, consider the common case (typical of procedure bod-
;ies) where the sequence has just one expression. What work
;will the execution procedure produced by Alyssaâ€™s program
;do? What about the execution procedure produced by the
;program in the text above? How do the two versions com-
;pare for a sequence with two expressions?

; 1. Sequence with just one expression.
; With Alyssa's version, the execution procedure will run (execute-sequence (list single-proc) env).
; There will be one call to execute-sequence.

; With the original version from the book, the procedure will be executed directly: (single-proc env)

; 2. With two expressions
; Alyssa: a recursive call to execute-sequence is made.
; This includes the conditional checks to to see if there are still elements in the list.
; Original: single call to a procedure that calls the two 'analyzed' procedures.

; With many expressions it looks like the original version will produce a lambda with many nested lambdas.
; We save the (null? ..) evaluations that are part of Alyssa's version.
